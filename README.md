Demonstration of Model-view-Presenter in android
I created two packages root,login. The root package has all files related to dagger2 implementation while the login package has model,view and presenter implementation in it,
Login Activity implements the View. Seperate class for model and presenter are alsp created. The repository for saving a data is neither clound nor database and nor files but memory.
